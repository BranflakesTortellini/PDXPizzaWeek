# Pizza Week Event Data Processing Scripts

## Overview

These scripts are designed to facilitate the exploration of Pizza Week events by scraping, processing, and organizing event data into a user-friendly Excel spreadsheet. The process is divided into three main scripts:

1. **Pizza_Week_Data_Pull.py**: Scrapes the main event page for Pizza Week, gathering details from individual event subpages, and saves the data to an Excel file.
2. **Pizza_Week_Data_Parse_v5.py**: Parses the previously saved Excel file, cleans and extracts specific information from the event descriptions, and exports an intermediate, organized Excel spreadsheet.
3. **Pizza_Week_Address_Split_Test_AI_v2.py** (Optional): Further processes the intermediate Excel file to correct and verify address data using an AI model, and then finalizes the Excel spreadsheet with reordered and optionally refined data columns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- For Scripts 1 and 2, the following libraries are required:
- 
    ```sh
     pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl tqdm sqlite3 tkinter html
- Script 3 is optional and requires these libraries in addition to the ones above:
-   ```sh
     pip openai
## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

 
     pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl tqdm sqlite3 tkinter html openai
     


**Note**: Script 3 requires a locally hosted LLM using LM Studio.

## Script 1: `Pizza_Week_Data_Pull.py`

### Setup
- Update the `MAIN_PAGE_URL` variable in the script with the URL of the main event page for the current or upcoming Pizza Week.

### Running the Script
- Execute the script in your terminal or command prompt.
- A file dialog will pop up, prompting you to choose a location and filename to save the pulled data. Choose your desired location, enter a filename, and click 'Save'.

## Script 2: `Pizza_Week_Data_Parse.py`

### Running the Script
- Execute the script in your terminal or command prompt.
- A file dialog will appear, asking you to select the Excel file generated by `Pizza_Week_Data_Pull.py`. Navigate to the file, select it, and click 'Open'.
- After the script processes the data, another file dialog will pop up, prompting you to save the intermediate Excel file. Choose your desired location, enter a filename, and click 'Save'.

## Script 3: `Pizza_Week_Address_Split_Test_AI.py` (Optional)

### Running the Script
- Execute the script in your terminal or command prompt.
- Select the intermediate Excel file generated by `Pizza_Week_Data_Parse_v5.py`.
- The script will process the data, verifying and correcting addresses using an AI model hosted locally through LM Studio, and reformat the data structure.
- After processing, it will prompt you to save the finalized Excel file. Choose your location, enter a filename, and click 'Save'.

### Note
Script 3 is completely optional and was developed as an advanced parsing exercise using a local LLM to help interpret inconsistent entries in a text field and help standardize them. Its implementation is for those interested in experimenting with AI-based data correction techniques. This script was created as a fun exercise to incorporate the usage of a locally hosted LLM provided by LM Studio (https://lmstudio.ai/). The LLM used was "delli/mistral-7b-address-validator-merged-gguf" but it has been tested with a variety of Mistral/Llaama and Phi-2 LLMS with equal success.  Please note that I do not officially endorse LM Studio or the LLM used, nor am I partnered with their creators.

## Final Output
The final Excel spreadsheet will contain thoroughly verified and organized information about the Pizza Week events, making it easy for users to explore their options with confidence.

## General Usage Notes
These scripts are designed to be used in sequence: run `Pizza_Week_Data_Pull_v2.py` first to collect the data, `Pizza_Week_Data_Parse_v5.py` to structure and clean that data, and optionally, `Pizza_Week_Address_Split_Test_AI_v2.py` to verify and finalize the data in an Excel file for user consumption.
