# Pizza Week Event Data Processing Scripts

## Overview

These scripts are designed to facilitate the exploration of pizza week events by scraping, processing, and organizing event data into a user-friendly Excel spreadsheet. The process is divided into two main scripts:

1. **Pizza_Week_Data_Pull.py** - Scrapes the main event page for pizza week, gathering details from individual event subpages, and saves the data to an Excel file.
2. **Pizza_Week_Data_Parse_v5.py** - Parses the previously saved Excel file, cleans and extracts specific information from the event descriptions, and exports a final, organized Excel spreadsheet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `requests`, `bs4` (BeautifulSoup), `pandas`, `tkinter`, `tqdm`, `re`, `html`
- Excel or any compatible spreadsheet software to view the final output.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas lxml openpyxl xlwt html5lib tqdm
```

## Script 1: `Pizza_Week_Data_Pull.py`

### Setup
- Update the `MAIN_PAGE_URL` variable in the script with the URL of the main event page for the current or upcoming pizza week.

### Running the Script
- Execute the script in your terminal or command prompt.
- A file dialog will pop up, prompting you to choose a location and filename to save the pulled data. Choose your desired location, enter a filename, and click 'Save'.

## Script 2: `Pizza_Week_Data_Parse_v5.py`

### Running the Script
- Execute the script in your terminal or command prompt.
- A file dialog will appear, asking you to select the Excel file generated by `Pizza_Week_Data_Pull.py`. Navigate to the file, select it, and click 'Open'.
- After the script processes the data, another file dialog will pop up, prompting you to save the final Excel file. Choose your desired location, enter a filename, and click 'Save'.

### Final Output
- The final Excel spreadsheet will contain organized and cleaned information about the pizza week events, making it easier for users to sort and choose their options for pizza week.

## General Usage Notes
- These scripts are designed to be used in sequence: first run `Pizza_Week_Data_Pull.py` to gather the data, and then use `Pizza_Week_Data_Parse_v5.py` to process that data into a final, sorted Excel file.
